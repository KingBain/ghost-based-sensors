# Ghost-Based Sensors (GBS): Observability for Ephemeral CI/CD Pipelines
 [![Continual Compliance](https://github.com/KingBain/ghost-based-sensors/actions/workflows/001-Example-Pipeline.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/KingBain/ghost-based-sensors/actions/workflows/001-Example-Pipeline.yaml)

Ghost-Based Sensors is an open-source project that brings compliance-grade, syscall-level observability to ephemeral CI/CD pipelines. Under the hood it leverages [Falco for Actions](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco-actions) as its engine—automating start/stop, rule injection, telemetry capture, and artifact packaging so you don’t have to deal with low-level configuration.

## Project Vision

Modern Continuous Integration and Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines are ephemeral in nature. Built Quick, Run Quick, Die Quick ... they vanishing once theyre completed their job. Yet these short lived environments remain largely unmonitored, creating a critical blind spot. Inspired by traditional "[Host-Based Sensors (HBS)](https://www.cyber.gc.ca/en/news-events/host-based-sensors)" and "[Cloud-Based Sensors (CBS)](https://www.cse-cst.gc.ca/en/accountability/transparency/reports/communications-security-establishment-annual-report-2022-2023)," I introduce **Ghost-Based Sensors (GBS)** which is my attempt to gain deeper visibility into these transient, short-lived build and deployment environments.

## Why Ghost-Based Sensors?

Ephemeral CI environments like GitHub Actions or Azure Pipelines spin up quickly on shared and public infrastructure, perform builds and tests, and disappear just as fast; _Do a double take - did I see a ghosts_. Traditional security monitoring tools designed for persistent infrastructure fail here. GBS workes to close or shrink this gap by capturing crucial telemetry, ensuring even short-lived pipelines activities are recorded.

## What Will Ghost-Based Sensors Do?

Leveraging lightweight instrumentation and eBPF-based telemetry, Ghost-Based Sensors will capture:

| Feature                 | Description                                                                                        | Method                  |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Process Telemetry       | Logs every process execution and command-line argument used during pipeline runs                   | Process Monitoring      |
| File System Activity    | Monitors file creations, deletions, and modifications to detect suspicious changes                 | File systyem monitoring |
| Network Connections/DNS | Records all outbound connections and DNS lookups to reveal data exfiltration or unauthorized calls | Network monitoring      |

The majority of the monitoring is done using Sysdig BPF probes into the github runner kernel, this is reffered to the ["Modern eBPF" probe](https://falco.org/blog/falco-modern-bpf-0-35-0/)

## Who Is This For?

Ghost‑Based Sensors (GBS) is tailored for teams and individuals who:

- **Rely on Shared/Public Runners:** You only have access to GitHub Actions, Azure Pipelines, or other public CI/CD runners—not self‑hosted agents.  
- **Work with Unclassified or Public Code:** Your projects don’t handle classified data, but you still need strong observability.  
- **Can’t Deploy Dedicated Monitoring Services:** You lack the resources or permissions to stand up long‑running agents, SIEMs, or logging infrastructures.  
- **Want to Build Their Own Reports:** You prefer open‑source, customizable tooling to generate your own forensic and audit reports.  
- **Need to Meet Observability Controls:** You must comply with standards like NIST or Canada’s GC ITSG‑33 for visibility, logging, and traceability in your software supply chain.  


## What Ghost-Based Sensors Will NOT Do

* **Prevention or Enforcement:** GBS is strictly focused on visibility and traceability. While prevention and active blocking of threats are important, they are outside the scope of this project.
* **Private Pipeline Support:** Initially, GBS targets publicly accessible code and public CI/CD runners. Although GBS could be adapted for private environments, our initial implementation will not cover private pipelines or environments explicitly.
* **Runner Hardening:** GBS does not harden or secure CI/CD runners themselves; it focuses solely on capturing telemetry and maintaining traceability.

## How Does it Work?

GBS will deploy as a containerized sensor, injected into CI pipelines via a custom GitHub Action or Azure Pipeline Task. The sensor will:

1. Automatically activate at the start of each pipeline job.
2. Collect detailed telemetry data throughout the build and test steps.
3. Export telemetry logs as artifacts immediately before the ephemeral environment disappears.

## Continual Compliance (GC ITSG-33)

Ghost-Based Sensors (GBS) maps directly to key Government of Canada security controls, so you get built-in evidence for continual compliance:

- **SI-4 Information System Monitoring**  
  Real-time eBPF telemetry (process, file, network events) captures attacks, anomalous behavior and unauthorized connections in your CI runners.

- **CA-7 Continuous Monitoring**  
  Automated start/stop of Sysdig/Falco plus post-run artifact analysis builds a fully instrumented, ongoing monitoring pipeline.

- **AU-2/3 Audit Events & Content**  
  Captures the right events (syscalls, process lifecycle, file I/O) with full context (timestamps, arguments, container labels) to satisfy audit-record requirements.

- **AU-6 Audit Review, Analysis & Reporting**  
  Produces raw `.scap` logs and high-level “changed-files” trails so you can review, analyze and report unusual activity on-demand.

- **CM-3 Configuration Change Control**  
  Your “changed-files” audit trail gives you an authoritative record of every source change made by the pipeline for systematic review.

- **CM-8 System Component Inventory**  
  Snapshots of Node.js/Python package manifests produce a precise inventory of runtime components for your CI environment.

- **RA-5 Vulnerability Scanning**  
  GBS outputs package manifests in a standard format so you can plug them into automated scanners (e.g. Dependabot, Snyk) for continuous vulnerability assessment.

- **SI-7 Software & Information Integrity**  
  Combined syscall tracing and file-change logs detect unauthorized modifications to your build artifacts or runner file system.

By including GBS in every run, you get hands-off, continual evidence that you’re meeting these ITSG-33 requirements—no extra scripts or manual audits needed.  

##  Getting Started

1. Add the GBS container or setup action to your CI job.
2. Launch the tracer via your container entrypoint or `pre` step.
3. Run your build/test/deploy steps as usual.
4. Stop sensors, collect data, and upload artifacts for analysis.


## Example Pipeline

An **example pipeline** demonstrates how to integrate Ghost-Based Sensors into your CI workflow. You can find it at:

```text
.github/workflows/001-Example-Pipeline.yaml
```

This reference pipeline showcases:

* Starting Sysdig in **analyze** mode to capture ephemeral system telemetry.
* Executing the normal job workload (e.g., checkout and a 10‑second count).
* Stopping Sysdig at the end of the job.
* Snapshotting installed **Node.js** and **Python** packages.
* Recording a **changed-files** log for Audit trail.
* Uploading package manifests, changed-files logs and scap style System Capture as artifacts.
* A subsequent **analyze** job(in the same action) that generates a detailed summary report.

Use this pipeline as a template for your own public CI/CD workflows to harness the full power of GBS within ephemeral runners.
